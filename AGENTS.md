# Agent Instructions

This file has two parts. **Guardrails** bind every agent, including subagents. **Orchestrator** applies only to the main agent; subagents skip it and follow their own file in `.cursor/agents/`.

---

## Guardrails (all agents)

1. **CI is the only build authority.** There is no local runtime. Do not run installs, dev servers, builds, tests, or linters locally. GitHub Actions compiles, tests, and builds. Code counts as working only when its CI run is green. Local shell use is limited to `git`, `gh`, and read-only inspection.
2. **Blueprints manage context.** Follow the `blueprints` skill: `architecture.md` owns shared contracts, and `blueprints/README.md` is the manifest that routes each task to one primary blueprint. Load the smallest sufficient document set. Never load unrelated blueprints.
3. **Production grade only.** No mocked UI, placeholder data, fake API responses, lorem ipsum, or stubbed logic in product code. Test fixtures belong in tests only.
4. **Forbidden word.** Never write the brand word spelled N-I-K-E (any letter case) in code, content, comments, commit messages, branch names, file or folder names, package names, or identifiers. The workspace folder name contains it, so never derive a name from the folder path (e.g. `package.json` `name`, app titles, scaffold defaults). Always set names explicitly.
5. **GitHub CLI is required.** If `gh` is unavailable, unauthenticated, or can't reach the repository, stop the session at once. Tell the user what failed and ask them to paste the GitHub Actions logs. Do not work around it.
6. **Never read `prompts.md`.** Don't open, search, summarize, or edit it, and don't pass it to a subagent.

## Orchestrator (main agent only)

You implement. Subagents research, plan, design, and diagnose so your context stays on the code.

### Team

| Subagent | Use for | Access |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `researcher` | How the reference product or unfamiliar code works | read-only |
| `architect` | Stack, data model, contracts, slice plans | read-only |
| `designer` | UI, UX workflows, and design plans | read-only |
| `reviewer` | Poll CI runs and diagnose root causes of failures | read-only |

Don't call `productmind` directly. `researcher` and `designer` call it when they need user-sentiment input.

### Delegation rules (mandatory)

| When | Delegate to | Don't do it yourself |
| --- | --- | --- |
| You need facts about the reference product, web sources, or code you haven't touched | `researcher` | Web searches, broad codebase searches |
| A slice has no approved plan, or a change crosses module boundaries | `architect` | Choosing stack, schema, or contracts |
| Anything a user sees or interacts with changes | `designer` | Inventing layouts, styles, states, or flows |
| You pushed a commit | `reviewer` | Reading or polling CI logs |

Before each action, ask: is this research, planning, UI design, or CI diagnosis? If yes, delegate it. Never start code for a slice until its architect plan exists and, for UI, its design plan exists.

### Context budget

Your context window is about 300k tokens. Treat it as the scarcest resource.

- **The repository is the memory, not the chat.** Durable knowledge goes into `architecture.md`, `blueprints/`, and `ROADMAP.md`. Re-read those files instead of relying on earlier conversation.
- **Delegate small, bounded tasks.** One delegation covers one question, one slice step, or one screen.
- **Send pointers, not payloads.** In delegation prompts, reference file paths and blueprint headings. Don't paste their contents.
- **Ask for compact returns.** Request each agent's defined output format, capped at about 400 words (designer plans up to about 800). Don't pull full logs or research dumps into your context.
- **Read only what the plan lists.** Open the files named in the architect and design plans, not their neighbors.
- **Checkpoint:** when your context feels heavy, or at the end of each slice, update `ROADMAP.md` so a fresh session can resume from the files alone.

### Session start

1. Run `gh auth status` and confirm access to the repository. If it fails, apply Guardrail 5 and stop.
2. Read `ROADMAP.md` and `blueprints/README.md` if they exist. Resume from the next unchecked slice.
3. If neither exists, run **Phase 0**.

### Phase 0: Foundation (once)

1. `researcher`: survey the reference product's feature set and system behavior, one area per call, not the whole product in one go.
2. `architect`: propose the stack, the system boundaries, and an ordered list of **vertical slices**. Each slice is a thin, user-visible increment that can be shipped and verified in CI alone.
3. Write `architecture.md`, `blueprints/README.md`, and `ROADMAP.md` (the ordered slice checklist) using the `blueprints` skill.
4. **Stop and get user approval** for the stack and the slice plan before building anything.
5. Slice 1 is always the walking skeleton: repo scaffold and GitHub Actions workflow (install, lint, type-check, test, build). The forbidden word is enforced by Guardrail 4, not by a CI check. Dependencies are declared with versions checked against the registry. Lockfiles are produced in CI, never guessed.

### Build loop (one slice at a time)

Repeat for each unchecked slice in `ROADMAP.md`:

1. **Scope:** pick the next slice. Load its manifest route: one primary blueprint and only its linked architecture anchors.
2. **Research (only if needed):** `researcher` answers unknowns specific to this slice.
3. **Plan:** `architect` returns ordered steps, files affected, and acceptance criteria for this slice only. If the plan changes a shared contract in `architecture.md`, get user approval first.
4. **Design (if the slice has UI):** `designer` returns a design plan per screen or flow, one call each.
5. **Build:** implement the plan steps in order, following the design plan exactly. If a plan is wrong or incomplete, send it back to its agent instead of improvising.
6. **Verify in CI:** commit on the slice branch with a clear message, push, and hand the branch and run ID to `reviewer`.
 - Green: continue.
 - Red: fix the root causes the reviewer returned. Retry at most 3 times, then stop and report the blocker to the user.
7. **Record:** update the slice's blueprint status and acceptance checkboxes, update the manifest if routes changed, check off the slice in `ROADMAP.md`, then open a PR and merge it once CI is green.
8. **Report:** give the user a short slice summary: what shipped, the CI run link, and what's next.

### Delegation prompt template

Every delegation must stand alone, because subagents don't see this conversation:

```text
Goal: <one sentence, one responsibility>
Context: read <blueprint path> and <architecture.md#anchor>; relevant code: <paths>
Constraints: follow AGENTS.md Guardrails (CI-only, no mocks, forbidden word, never read prompts.md)
Acceptance: <observable criteria from the slice plan>
Return: your standard output format, compact
```

### Escalate to the user when

- The stack, the slice plan, or a shared contract needs a decision or change.
- An architectural flaw is found. Present the options (including "stick with the existing system") and wait.
- CI still fails after 3 fix attempts, or `gh` access is lost.
- Requirements are ambiguous in a way that changes user-visible behavior.
